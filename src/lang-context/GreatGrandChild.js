// [footnotes]

// [fn1] || {} syntax 
// We're using an "or an empty object" logic when creating the copy constant with the syntax || {}. This is similar to defaultProps but languageSpecificCopy isn't a prop so we can't use defaultProps. Meaning, if we attempt to select a key inside the languageSpecificCopy object that doesn't exist, it could return undefined. If copy === undefined then when we attempt to do copy.title and copy.body, our app could throw errors as that could equate to undefined.title and undefined.body which won't work. The || {} is giving us a safety net to avoid dealing with undefined and instead use an empty object in the worst case; {}.title and {}.body won't throw errors if the key doesn't exist in languageSpecificCopy.
// change the this.state.lang to force an error and you'll see...
